# IP Tracking – Task 0: Basic IP Logging Middleware

## Project Overview
This task implements a basic IP tracking system in a Django application.  
The goal is to log the **IP address**, **request path**, and **timestamp** of every incoming HTTP request using Django middleware.

This functionality is foundational for security monitoring, auditing, and future features such as rate limiting and IP blacklisting.
